Algorithm

- Computer randomly selects a number between 1 and 15

- User inputs a single guess between 1 and 15

- If user guess does not match computer's chosen number:

    The user will lose a point from a starting 10 pts
    
    If the number chosen was too low:
        > computer will display "higher" in a pop-up
    
    If the number chosen was too high:
        > computer will display "lower" in a pop-up
        
    User guesses again until the guess matches the computer's chosen number
        
- Else If user guess matches computer's chosen number:
    
    The user gains 10 pts to their score
    
    Computer randomly chooses another number to guess
